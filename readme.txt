this zip file only contains the wokwi project made in vscode. the video explanation is included in the drive and the link is provided in comments
open the project using vscode, then build it and then open the diagram.json file to simulate the circuit
the codes files are included in the src folder and the header files are included in the include folder

Also there was sometimes an issue of the server not responding when using the test.mosquitto.org broker. So i have implemented the mosquitto mqtt service
on an oracal server i purchased and that is being used as the broker
server - ora6.emanate.io
